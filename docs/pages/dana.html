    <p>Shakyamuni Buddha - Bodhi Garden Brighton Buddhist Meditation &amp; Dharma CentreThe Bodhi Garden operates on the traditional Buddhist principle of dana, which is the Buddhist word for ‘generosity’, ‘giving’, or ‘mutual support’. All Bodhi Garden activities are freely offered. No charge is made to participants on day retreats.</p>
<p>Dana is an expression of appreciation and gratitude. It is also a principle that lies at the heart of the Buddhist tradition and has provided the basis for the continuation of its teachings for over 25 centuries. Dana means that Buddhist practice and teachings can be made available to everyone.</p>
<p>Giving a donation on a day retreat At the end of a retreat, you are given the opportunity to offer dana to the teacher in the form of a voluntary financial contribution. Your generosity is greatly appreciated. It is what enables the continuation of the teacher’s work and, by extension, the Buddhist teachings.</p>
<p>In this modern age, where we are used to paying for things, it can be challenging to be offered the choice of how much to give! Please remember that, given the nature of their work, teachers receive no income for their time and energy. Your support is an invaluable and very practical contribution to the teacher, who relies on yours and others’ generosity for their livelihood. Thank you.</p>
<p>Donating to this charitable trust The Bodhi Garden itself relies on the generosity of others for its existence. It is only by the act of giving on the part of those who derive benefit from what it offers that its continuation is made possible. Consider that what people have given to support previous Bodhi Garden retreats has made it possible for future retreats to take place! As a registered charity, we also offer support to a small number of Buddhist monastic teachers and Buddhist groups and charities with no independent means. We are grateful for any additional support you may wish to give us.</p>
