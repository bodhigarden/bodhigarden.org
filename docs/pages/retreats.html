    <p>This page contains general information about retreats. For information about specific retreats, please go the retreat calendar page.</p>
<h2 id="about-day-retreats">About day retreats</h2>
<p>The Bodhi Garden organises one-day and two-day Buddhist meditation retreats in the Brighton and Hove area. These are led by a variety of respected teachers from across the different Buddhist traditions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Newcomers to meditation are welcome. Instruction is always given (unless specifically stated otherwise).</p></li>
<li><p>Retreats are offered on a dana basis.</p></li>
<li><p>In order to attend a retreat, you must register your place. You can do this via the retreat calendar page. We request that you read the information about dana before registering. We further request that you register for yourself alone.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-on-a-day-retreat">What to expect on a day retreat</h2>
<p>Day retreats offer a wonderful opportunity to practise meditation in a peaceful and supportive setting, and receive guidance and instruction from an experienced teacher.</p>
<p>A typical day retreat involve periods of sitting and walking meditation. The teacher offers meditation instruction and a talk on meditation, or a related Buddhist theme. There is usually an opportunity for questions and answers. Newcomers to meditation may be offered additional instruction. Experienced meditators can use the day as an opportunity to develop and deepen their practice.</p>
<p>Retreats are normally held in ‘noble silence’. Depending on the nature of the retreat, most verbal communication is usually restricted to the beginning and the end of the day (and possibly tea-breaks). These are the best times to catch up with new and old friends.</p>
<p>A standard request we make is to abide by the Five Precepts (the basic code of Buddhist ethics) for the duration of the retreat. The Five Precepts involve abstaining from (i) taking life, (ii) taking what is not given, (iii) sexual misconduct, (iv) false speech, (v) intoxicating drink and drugs that cause heedlessness.</p>
<p>A lunch break divides the morning and afternoon. All participants are invited to contribute to the lunch by bringing vegetarian food to share. Please bring food that is already prepared.</p>
<p>Venue details are included in the information about individual retreats. This website also offers a lift share facility where you can request or offer a lift to the retreat venue.</p>
<p>Meditation cushions and chairs are available at the venue. However, if you have a meditation cushion we recommend you bring it with you since cushions may be limited on the day. Suggested attire is loose, comfortable clothes that allow you to sit with ease and which are appropriate for walking meditation periods outdoors.</p>
<p>At the end of the retreat, participants are given the opportunity to offer dana (a donation) to the teacher. What you give helps to cover the basic costs of the day and contributes directly to the teacher’s livelihood.</p>
